The scope of the project encompasses the utilization of advanced data analysis and predictive modelling techniques to predict and assess students' academic performance. The project will involve gathering, processing, and analysing relevant student data, identifying key factors influencing educational outcomes, and developing a predictive model. Additionally, the scope includes implementing a user-friendly interface for end-users, such as educators and administrators, to access and interpret the predictions effectively.
